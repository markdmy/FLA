        <p>Free Laundry Access Program is a program to help individuals and families who are experiencing
          financial challenges living in Canada with access to clean laundry free of cost.</p>
        <div><br /></div>

        <h1 id="how">HOW IT WORKS</h1>
        <div><br /></div>
        <p>Eligible residents will receive a credit at each event date for Free Laundry Access, which will be based on
          number of individuals within a given household.
          Free Laundry Access program is ONLY offered on announced Event dates, times and at specific locations. Outside
          of the Event dates and times, unfortunately the program is NOT available
          Remember, each Event is coordinated with our laundromat partners in advance in order to provide the Free
          Laundry Access program and services. Outside of the Event date our laundromat partners do not have the
          resources required to run the program.
          Amount of credit per event is set at a maximum of 4 loads or 30 pounds of laundry per individual member within
          a household. </p>
      </div>

      <p>Participants will have access to washers and dryers with the costs of washing and drying covered, free laundry
        detergent and dryer sheets for each load. No cash will be given to Participants.
      <div><br /></div>
      For each machine used, Participant(s) agrees to fill the washer 3/4 full of laundry to be laundered. If the
      machine is less than 3/4 full, the laundry must be combined with other laundry to meet the minimum requirement.
      The Participant also agrees to fill dryers 1/2 full of laundry to be dry, and if it is less than 1/2 full of wet
      laundry, the wet laundry must be combined with other wet laundry to meet the minimum load for drying.
      <div><br /></div>
      Of course there will be exceptions to this rule and it will be up-to the digression of the Staff/Volunteer from
      Free Laundry Access.
      <div><br /></div>
      Free Laundry Access Program is valid for a 12-month period once you have been accepted into the program and
      credits do not get carry over into the next year, as credit is issued at each event when you are present.
      Participant(s) need to re-apply each year and provide the required documents.
      <div><br /></div>
      Free Laundry Access is privately funded through generous public donations and corporate donations and sponsorship.
