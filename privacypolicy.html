        <h3>1. Key Points</h3>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            Free Laundry Access (referred to below as “we”, or “us”) understands that your time is valuable.
            Therefore, below we have set out some important key points of our Privacy Policy.
            We encourage you to read our full Privacy Policy, as it contains important information for you.
            <br />
            <br />
            What personal information do we collect and how do we collect it?
            <br />
            <br />
            The type of personal information we collect depends on the type client you are – Services Recipient, Donors/Prospective Donor (“Donor”),
            Volunteer/Employee Applicant (“Applicant”) or General Contact (collectively, “Client(s)”).

            <br />

            parties in the course of evaluations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Donors: We collect personal information directly from Donors, including name, contact information and payment information
            necessary to process a donation. We may also collect a Donor’s personal information from Donor Lists that we rent from other organizations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Applicants: We collect personal information directly from Applicants, including name, date of birth, contact

        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            Why do we collect personal information and how do we use it?
            <br />
            <br />
            The reason that we collect your personal information depends on the type of Client you are- Services Recipient, Donor, Applicant or General Contact.
            <br />
            <br />
            We collect Services Recipient personal information to facilitate the use of our Services. We may use personal
            information about Services Recipients for research purposes, program evaluation and optimizing the quantity and quality of our Services.
            <br />
            <br />
            We collect Donor personal information for the purposes of fundraising and marketing, to facilitate
            donations and to report to you on how we are using your donation.
            <br />
            <br />

            <br />
            <br />

            Additionally, we use email addresses and phone numbers to contact Clients to resolve inquiries and reply to questions.
            <br />
            <br />
            Personal information that we collect about devices and use of Our Online Platforms through Cookies and other online
            trackers is used in aggregate and de-identified form to evaluate and improve our services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            How do we share or disclose personal information?
            <br />
            <br />
            We will never sell or rent Client personal information to other organizations.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may share Services Recipient personal information with government for the purposes of assessment,
            assistance, funding, advocacy or humanitarian diplomacy.
            <br />
            <br />
            We use Third Party Service Providers who may require access to Client personal information in order to perform
            services for us, such as back-office support functions and website administration services on Our Online Platforms.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may disclose or share Client personal information for fraud prevention or as otherwise permitted
            or required by applicable law, including to law enforcement, courts and regulatory authorities.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may share Applicant personal information with third parties, such as employers, for the
            purpose of verifying credentials, providing evaluation or assessment of our training programs.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may share limited Applicant personal information with third party background check services
            with the Applicant’s express consent at the time of collection.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            How do we protect personal information?
            <br />
            <br />
            We have implemented Safeguards to protect personal information under our control.
            We regularly review our practices to ensure they align with reasonable practices appropriate to
            the level of sensitivity of the information, in order to safeguard personal information against loss or
            theft, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            What are the risks?
            <br />
            <br />
            Although we take steps to safeguard the personal information under our control,
            "perfect security" does not exist online or elsewhere. In particular, we cannot guarantee
            the security of information posted or transmitted using Our Online Platforms or via email.
            It is possible that third parties may unlawfully intercept or access such information.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            What are your choices?
            <br />
            <br />
            Clients may request access to and review of their personal information in our possession, subject to certain limitations.
            <br />
            <br />
            Clients may also request that we change or delete their personal information in our possession, which we will
            make best efforts to comply with, subject to certain limitations.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
            What else should you know?
            <br />
            <br />
            Although we generally endeavor to store personal information in Canada, we sometimes use cloud services
            provided by Third Party Service Providers to store personal information that we collect, including Third
            Party Service Providers located outside Canada. This means that your personal information may be transferred
            to, or stored in, another country and accessible to foreign courts, law enforcement and national security authorities.
            A structured review process and additional revisions are completed as dictated by legal and legislative requirements,
            and we will provide transparency regarding any transfer or storage of your information outside Canada.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may amend our Privacy Policy from time-to-time. Please check Our Online Platforms regularly for updates.
            <br />
            <br />
            You can contact us any time with questions, complaints or requests to access, amend or rectify your personal information.
        </p>

        <h3>2. The Free Laundry Access Privacy Policy</h3>
        <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            At Free Laundry Access (referred to below as “we” or “us), we believe that you should understand the
            way in which we collect, use, disclose and protect your personal information.
            <br />
            <br />
            We operate on several domains, including freelaundryaccess.ca, freelaundryaccess.org,
            and freelaundryaccess.com (collectively referred to as, “Our Online Platforms”).
            <br />
            <br />
            “Personal information” is any information that directly or indirectly identifies you.
            However, this Policy does not apply to information that is publicly available, as defined by applicable laws.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h3>3. Our Mission</h3>
        <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            Our mission is to help people and communities in Canada have access to clean laundry services.
        </p>
        <br />
        <br />

        <h3>4. What Personal Information Do We Collect and How Do We Collect It?</h3>
        <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            The personal information we collect depends upon the type of Free Laundry Access client you are –
            Services Recipient, Donor, Volunteer/Employee Applicant (“Applicant”) or General Contact (collectively, our “Clients”).
            <br />
            <br />
            A “Services Recipient” either uses or has requested to use Free Laundry Access services or has provided their
            information in connection with a request for an assessment of needs.
            <br />
            <br />
            A “Donor” makes a donation of money, securities or gifts-in-kind to Free Laundry Access or
            has indicated to Free Laundry Access or to its agents an intention to make a donation. A Donor also includes prospective
            donors whose contact information is included on the Donor Lists that Free Laundry Access has rented from other organizations.
            <br />
            <br />
            An “Applicant” has inquired about or applied for a career or volunteer opportunity with Free Laundry Access.
            <br />
            <br />
            Finally, a “General Contact” is an individual other than those described above,
            who contacts Free Laundry Access for any reason, either via Our Online Platforms, email, telephone, fax, in person or otherwise.
            <br />
            <br />
            A. Personal Information about Services Recipients
            <br />
            <br />
            When Services Recipients apply or register for our Services, they are generally required to provide
            personal information including their name, date of birth, address, phone number, email, emergency address,
            gender, language preference or similar information regarding their partner and/or children or other household members.
            We may need to collect additional service-specific information and/or documents, depending on the situation.
            <br />
            <br />
            We collect personal information from Services Recipients in the following ways:
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Online Platforms: Services Recipients can sign up to receive access to the Services through the Our Online Platforms.
            <br />
            <br />
            In person through a Free Laundry Access representative: Services Recipients can sign up to receive access to
            the Services in person at a designated Free Laundry Access Event.
            <br />
            <br />
            Over the phone: Service Recipients can provide personal information to Free Laundry Access
            representatives over the phone, including through our call centres and other personnel.
            <br />
            <br />
            Social Media: Services Recipients can provide personal information to Free Laundry Access representatives
            through our social media accounts, such as Facebook and Instagram. In these situations, we attempt to
            collect as little personal information as possible (full name and phone number), and redirect the
            Service Recipient to one of Our Online Platforms.
            <br />
            <br />
            Some Services Recipients may choose to provide additional information. For example, in the “General Information Box”
            free-form field on Our Online Platforms, Services Recipients may provide any other information that they consider
            relevant to their application for Services. In order to prevent Services Recipients from disclosing sensitive
            information unnecessarily, we note next to the General Information Box that Services Recipients should not provide
            sensitive information such as medical or financial information.
            <br />
            <br />
            B. Personal Information about Donors
            <br />
            <br />
            When Donors provide donations or an intention to donate, they are generally required to provide certain
            personal information including name, contact information and payment information required to process their donation.
            <br />
            <br />
            The following is a list of the specific ways we collect Donor personal information:
            <br />
            <br />
            Donor Lists: Free Laundry Access rents donor lists containing contact information for Donors from other
            organizations (“Donor Lists”). We use a Third-Party Service Provider to facilitate rental of Donor Lists.
            <br />
            <br />
            Mail Solicitation: We collect the name, contact information and payment information of a Donor who
            responds to solicitations through the mail (“Free Laundry Access Mail Solicitation”).
            <br />
            <br />
            Electronic Donations: We collect the name, contact information and payment information of a Donor
            who donates electronically via Our Online Platforms.
            <br />
            <br />
            Face-to-Face and Telemarketing: We collect the name, contact information and payment information of a Donor who
            donates via face-to-face canvassers or through a telemarketing campaign.

            <br />
            Text-to-Donate: We only receive the cell phone number of a Donor who donates via a text message sent from their cell phone.
            The management of these donations is handled via a regulated telecommunications body and Free Laundry Access only receives
            limited donor information, such as cell phone carrier and date, time and amount of the transaction.

            <br />
            Donations made directly at a Free Laundry Access Event or Office or through a third party fundraiser: We collect the name,

            or a Donor who makes a donation through a third party fundraiser that collected donations and performed fundraising on Free Laundry Access’ behalf.

            F.  Why Do We Collect Personal Information and How Do We Use It?
            <br />
            <br />
            Please note that, in order to facilitate the purposes outlined below, we may share Client personal information with Third
            Party Service Providers. For more information on these practices, please go to How Do We Share or Disclose Personal Information?
            <br />
            <br />
            <ul>
                <li>
                    i. Services Recipient personal information
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We use the personal information provided by Services Recipients for purposes related to the provision of our Free Laundry Access Services.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We may also use Service Recipient personal information for research purposes and to respond to incidents, investigations and complaints.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We also use certain personal information provided by Services Recipients to authenticate or verify their identity.
                    This authentication is done by checking the information provided by the Services Recipient against publicly available databases,
                    and/or information held by government bodies and credit check agencies.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We may also communicate with Services Recipients via their email address, phone number and mailing address.
                    Services Recipient email addresses will also be used to send service-related notices such as security and fraud notices.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    ii. Donor personal information
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We collect and use Donor personal information for the purpose of allowing Donors to contribute money,
                    Gifts in Kind or securities to Free Laundry Access or to express their intention to make a donation to Free Laundry Access.
                    Donor personal information may also be collected to report back on how their donation was used and to solicit further donations.
                    We use software from a Third-Party Service Provider to internally track a Donor’s donation pattern and other donation-related activity
                    within Free Laundry Access (e.g., Free Laundry Access tracks when it receives a donation from a Donor, or when a Donor calls to request
                    a donation receipt).
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    Without limiting the above, we use the Donor information contained on Donor Lists that we rent from third parties
                    to contact Donors by mail for the purposes of providing information about Free Laundry Access and its programs and Services, and
                    to solicit donations. We use a Third-Party Service Provider to facilitate rental of Donor Lists, and Donors may contact us at any time
                    to opt-out of receiving our mailers.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We may also communicate with Donors via their email address. Donors can choose not to receive such emails by opting out at
                    any time by “unsubscribing” or contacting us at info@freelaundryaccess.com. We may also use Donor email addresses to send service-related
                    notices such as security and fraud notices.
                    <br />
                    <br />

                    <br />
                    We use Applicant personal information to process inquiries and applications related to career and volunteer opportunities at
                    Free Laundry Access. In particular, we use Applicant personal information for the purposes of assessing Applicants’ suitability
                    for career opportunities with Free Laundry Access, communicating with Applicants and completing the
                    hiring or onboarding process for successful candidates.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    We may also communicate with Applicants via their email address or phone number.
                    Applicant email addresses will also be used to send service-related notices such as security and fraud notices.

                    <br />
                    We use General Contact personal information for the purpose of facilitating communications between Free Laundry Access and the individual,
                    and responding to enquiries from individuals who have reached out to us. We may also communicate with General Contacts via their email address.
                    General Contact email addresses will also be used to send service-related notices such as security and fraud notices.

        <h3>6. How Do We Share or Disclose Personal Information?</h3>
        <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            Your personal information is only accessed or disclosed to Free Laundry Access personnel who have a need to know such
            information to perform their job duties. These Free Laundry Access personnel will vary depending on the type of Client you are
            and the nature of the Services you are receiving.
            <br />
            <br />
            We do not sell personal information provided to us by Clients, or disclose it to any third party marketers.
            However, information may be shared or disclosed to third parties in the following circumstances:
            <br />
            <br />
            A. Third Party Service Providers
            <br />
            <br />
            There are certain services supplied to us by third parties (“Third Party Service Providers”).
            <br />
            <br />
            These Third Party Service Providers use your personal information to provide their services to us Third Party Service
            Providers may assist us with a variety of functions including with research, information storage, mail and delivery, fundraising,
            security, insurance, professional advisory (including legal, accounting and auditing advice), Donor List rentals, banking, payment
            processing, credit reporting or technology services.
            <br />
            <br />
            We have selected Third Party Service Providers who meet our standards for privacy and data security, but they may also have their own
            specific policies regarding the collection, use and disclosure of personal information. If you would like to contact any
            Third Party Service Provider for more information regarding their policies, you may contact Free Laundry Access as described
            below for information regarding the identity of the relevant third.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although we generally endeavor to store personal information in Canada, we sometimes use cloud services provided by Third Party
            Service Providers to store personal information that we collect, including Third Party Service Providers located outside Canada.
            Please note that, given the nature of cloud services, personal information of Clients may be stored outside Canada, anywhere in the world,
            and may be accessible to foreign courts, law enforcement and national security authorities in the jurisdiction(s) where it is
            transferred or stored. We will provide appropriate notices regarding transfer or storage of personal information outside Canada, in accordance
            with applicable laws and regulatory guidance.
            <br />
            <br />
            B. Third Party Links
            <br />
            <br />
            Our Online Platforms may contain links to other websites or Internet resources which are provided solely for your convenience
            and information. When you click on one of those links you are contacting another website or Internet resource. We have no responsibility or
            liability for, or control over, those other websites or Internet resources or their collection, use and disclosure of your personal information.
            We encourage you to read the privacy policies of those other websites to learn how they collect and use your personal information.
            <br />
            <br />
            C. Legal Requirements
            <br />
            <br />
            There are circumstances where we may use or disclose personal information without notice or consent when required by law or lawful authority.
            For example, from time to time, we may be compelled by legal action to release information (e.g., statutory reporting obligation, search
            warrant, court order, bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings etc.).
            <br />
            <br />
            In certain circumstances, we may also be permitted by law to collect, use or disclose information without the consent of the individual
            concerned. For example, we may disclose personal information without consent to investigate a potential breach of law or contract, to
            collect on a debt, or in certain emergency situations that threaten the life, health or security of an individual.
            <br />
            <br />
            D. Donor Lists (Donor-Specific)
            <br />
            <br />
            We rent Donor Lists from other organizations. Donor Lists contain the name and mailing address of Donors. We may send a limited
            number of mailers to such Donors containing information about Free Laundry Access and its programs and Services, and requesting donations.
            This is an important way for us to find other Donors who will support our work.
            <br />
            <br />
            Organizations that share Donor Lists with Free Laundry Access are responsible for ensuring that they have consent from relevant
            individuals before doing so, and for otherwise ensuring that their practices comply with applicable privacy laws. We require the
            Third Party Service Provider that facilitates our rental of Donor Lists to take appropriate steps to confirm that required notices
            have been provided to, and consents have been obtained from, the relevant individuals In addition, Donors may choose to have their
            personal information removed from the Donor Lists in Free Laundry Access’ possession by contacting us at info@freelaundryaccess.com.
            <br />
            <br />
            Exceptions to this Privacy Policy
            <br />
            <br />
            Government Entities: In some circumstances, we are contracted by government entities to provide assistance to
            individuals on behalf of these entities. Separate policies and public privacy laws, as applicable, may govern these activities.
            In these circumstances, individuals will be provided with access to such policies and this Privacy Policy may not apply.
            <br />
            <br />
            Free Laundry Access Employees and Volunteers: This Privacy Policy does not apply to Free Laundry Access employees and volunteers
            (“Free Laundry Access personnel”). Internal policies apply to Free Laundry Access personnel.
            <br />

        <h3>7.  How Do We Protect Personal Information?</h3>
        <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            We protect the personal information using physical, technological and organizational safeguards (collectively, the “Safeguards”).
            We regularly review our practices to ensure they align with reasonable industry practices appropriate to the level of sensitivity to
            safeguard personal information against loss or theft, unauthorized access, alteration or disclosure.
            <br />
            <br />
            Despite using the Safeguards outlined above, "perfect security" does not exist, particularly online. We cannot guarantee the security
            of information posted or transmitted via Our Online Platforms. Third parties may unlawfully intercept or access such information. If you
            think someone is impersonating Free Laundry Access, that there has been a breach of your privacy, or you believe that you are the victim of fraud,
            please contact us as soon as possible.
            <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <h3>8.  How Do We Obtain Consent to Collect, Use and Disclose Personal Information?</h3>
        <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            When you choose to become a Client of Free Laundry Access, you are consenting to our collection, use and disclosure of your personal
            information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. We may seek additional consent where required by law or in situations where we consider
            further consent to be necessary or appropriate.
            <br />
            <br />
            We may collect personal information of potential Services Recipients without their consent in the event of an emergency.
            In these situations, we may collect personal information from organizations such as the fire department, governmental authorities,
            or even a civilian that notices an individual in distress and who may require our Services. In these scenarios, we strive to collect only
            the minimum amount of personal information that we need in the circumstances.
            <br />
            <br />
            Clients are free to refuse or withdraw their consent to the collection, use or disclosure of their personal information at any time upon
            reasonable notice in writing to Free Laundry Access, subject to certain restrictions as may be permitted by applicable laws. Clients may decline
            to give Free Laundry Access their personal information; however, this decision may hinder our ability to provide Services (if applicable),
            or generally interact with such Clients.
            <br />
            <br />
        </p>
        <h3>9.  How Do We Maintain Accuracy and Allow Individual Access to Personal Information?</h3>
        <p>
            <br />
            <br />
            We endeavor to ensure that any personal information provided to us by Clients is as accurate, current and complete as necessary in
            order to meet the reason for which we collected it.
            <br />
            <br />
            For example, the following mechanisms allow individuals the opportunity to advise us of any potential inaccuracies in the
            information that we hold about them:
            <br />
            <br />
            A. Access
            <br />
            <br />
            Clients may request access to and review of their personal information in the possession or control of Free Laundry Access.
            However, access may be declined where permitted or required by applicable law, which may include (without limitation) the following circumstances:
            <br />
            <br />
            •	the information is protected by solicitor-client (between a lawyer and their client) privilege;
            <br />
            <br />
            •	disclosure of the personal information would compromise the confidential information of another individual or threaten the safety of
            another person; or
            <br />
            <br />
            •	non-disclosure of the personal information is required or permitted by law.
            <br />
            <br />
            B. Requests to Change or Delete Personal Information
