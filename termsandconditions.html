        that is likely to cause confusion among customers, or in any manner that
        may discredit Free Laundry Access. All other trademarks not owned by
        Free Laundry Access that appear on the Site are the property of their
        respective owners, who may or may not be affiliated with, connected to,

        We are not responsible for the content of any sites that may be linked
        to or from the Site. These links are provided for your information or
        convenience only and you agree that any access to them shall be at your

        <br />
      </p>

      <h3>DISCLAIMERS AND LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY</h3>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        The Site is provided on an "AS IS," "as available" basis. Free Laundry
        Access does not warrant that use of the Site will be uninterrupted or
        error-free. Free Laundry Access does not warrant the accuracy,
        integrity, or completeness of the Content provided on the Site or the
        products or services offered for sale on the Site. Further, Free Laundry
        Access makes no representation that Content provided on the Site is
        applicable or appropriate for use in locations outside of Canada.
        <br />
        <br />
        Free Laundry Access specifically disclaims all warranties of any kind,
        whether expressed or implied, including but not limited to warranties of
        title, implied warranties of merchantability or warranties of fitness
        for a particular purpose. You expressly agree that your access to,
        viewing of, browsing, visiting or use of the Site is at your sole risk.
        <br />
        <br />
        Under no circumstances shall Free Laundry Access be liable for any
        direct, indirect, incidental, special, or consequential damages that
        result from the use of or inability to use the Site, including but not
        limited to reliance by a user on any information obtained at the Site,
        or that result from mistakes, omissions, interruptions, deletion of
        files or e-mail, errors, defects, viruses, delays in operation or
        transmission, or any failure of performance, whether or not resulting
        from acts of God, communications failure, theft, destruction or
        unauthorized access to Free Laundry Access records, programs or
        services. The foregoing limitation of liability shall apply whether in
        an action at law, including but not limited to contract, negligence, or
        other tortuous action; or an action in equity, even if an authorized
        representative of Free Laundry Access has been advised of or should have
        knowledge of the possibility of such damages. You hereby acknowledge
        that this paragraph shall apply to all Content, merchandise and services
        available through the Site. Because some jurisdictions do not allow the
        exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental
        damages, in such jurisdictions, liability is limited to the fullest
        extent permitted by law. You assume all risks when purchasing products
        for a commercial or business use or application.
        <br />
        <br />

      <br />
      <p>
        We may terminate your access or suspend your right to access to all or
        part of the Site, without notice, for any conduct that we, in our sole
        discretion, believe is in violation of any applicable law, is in breach
        of these Terms and Conditions or is harmful to the interests of other
        users or Free Laundry Access.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>USAGE BY MINORS</h3>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        By providing Free Laundry Access with any information, you represent to
        us that you are legally permitted to enter into a binding contract (18
        years of age or older in most jurisdictions) or, if you are under the
        legal age of consent, you have the express permission from your parent
        or guardian and that any information you provide to us is not
        inaccurate, deceptive or misleading.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>APPLICABLE LAW</h3>
      <br />
      <br />
      <p>
        If you access the Site, you agree that the laws of the Province of
        Ontario, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will govern
        these Terms and Conditions and any dispute of any sort that might arise
        between you and Free Laundry Access.
      </p>
      <br />
      <br />
      <h3>DISPUTES</h3>

      <br />
      <p>
        If you access the Site, any dispute relating in any way to your visit to
        the Site, to these Terms and Conditions, to our policies, to our
        advertising or solicitation practices or to products you purchase
        through the Site shall be submitted to confidential arbitration in
        Toronto, Ontario, Canada, except that, to the extent you have in any
        manner violated or threatened to violate Free Laundry Access’
        intellectual property rights, Free Laundry Access may seek injunctive or
        other appropriate relief in any court in Canada. Arbitration under this
        Agreement shall be conducted under the rules then prevailing of the
        Arbitrations Act, Ontario. The arbitrator's award shall be binding and
        may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction. To
        the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, no arbitration under
        this Agreement shall be joined to an arbitration involving any other
        party subject to this Agreement, whether through class arbitration
        proceedings or otherwise.
      </p>
      <br />
